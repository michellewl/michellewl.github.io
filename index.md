Hello! I'm Michelle, and I'm a first-year PhD student with the [AI4ER CDT](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge.

I completed my BA and MSci in Natural Sciences (Biological) at the University of Cambridge, specialising in Chemistry and Atmospheric Chemistry for my final year. During my MRes with the CDT, I studied the association between NO<sub>2</sub> air pollution exposure and human breast cancer incidence in London, using LSTM networks. I'm now in the first year of my PhD project which explores machine learning applications in the study of air pollution and human health.
