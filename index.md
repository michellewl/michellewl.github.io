# PhD research
My work pulls elements from multiple STEM disciplines across Atmospheric Chemistry, Epidemiology, Computer Science and Sociology. I research the impact of air quality on human health, with particular interest in the context of social inequity in urban areas. My current research focuses on Greater London and vehicle-emitted pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and particulates. I work with large datasets and explore the applications of machine learning techniques, such as specific types of neural networks which can handle data across detailed spatial and temporal ranges.

# Academic background
I completed my BA and MSci in Natural Sciences (Biological) at the University of Cambridge, specialising in Chemistry and Atmospheric Chemistry for my final year. During my MRes with the [AI4ER CDT](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk), I studied the association between NO<sub>2</sub> air pollution exposure and human breast cancer incidence in London, using LSTM networks. Now hosted at the [Centre for Atmospheric Science](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/mwlw3), I'm in the third year of my PhD project which explores machine learning applications in the study of air pollution and human health.
