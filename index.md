# PhD research
My work pulls elements from multiple STEM disciplines across Atmospheric Chemistry, Epidemiology, Computer Science and Sociology. I research the impact of air quality on human health, with particular interest in the context of social inequity in urban areas. My current research focuses on Greater London and vehicle-emitted pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and particulates. I work with large datasets and explore the applications of machine learning techniques, such as specific types of neural networks which can handle data across detailed spatial and temporal ranges.
